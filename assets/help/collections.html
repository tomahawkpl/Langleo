		<h1>Collections screen</h1>
		<p>
		This screen lists all the collections you currently have. Each item
		in the list contains it's name, flags of languages, overall statistics and
		progress information. If a collection is disabled only it's name and flags
		of used languages are shown.
		</p>
		<p>To see contents of a collection simply click on it. To create a new collection press 'Menu->New'.
		Click and hold on a collection to edit or delete it.
		</p>
		<h2>Backup/restore</h2>
		<p>
		There are 2 options in the menu here which let you backup and restore your data using your SD
		card. Use it to prevent data loss when you're going to wipe your phone's internal memory,
		for example during a system update.
